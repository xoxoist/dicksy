## Quick Start

Getting started with Wavebox is as easy as 1-2-3! Here's a quick example of setting up a basic Flask app:

### Main
```python
from flask import Flask, Blueprint, Response, jsonify
from werkzeug.exceptions import NotFound, BadRequest
from wavebox.definitions import Applications
from wavebox.components.exceptions import FundamentalException

class ApplicationName(Applications):

    def __init__(self, flask_app: Flask):
        super().__init__(flask_app, Blueprint('root', flask_app.name, url_prefix="/"))

    def global_handle_http_exception(self, ex: FundamentalException) -> Response:
        pass

def main():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    application_name = ApplicationName(app)
    application_name.start()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Save this as `app.py`, and you're ready to go! Run your app with `python app.py`, and visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to see it in action.
